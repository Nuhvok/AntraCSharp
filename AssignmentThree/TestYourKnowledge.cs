         * (7 Overloading allows multiple methods with the same name
         *      and different parameters to exist. The appropriate

         * (8 A field is a literal memory location that either holds
         *      data or a reference to an object. A property is a 
         *      construct that manages the getting and setting of a

         *      that must be implemented by the implementing class.
         *      Abstract classes have similar collections of
         *      prototypes, but they can also include data fields
         *      and must be inherited, not implemented.
